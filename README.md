# MLP from Scratch - Week 1

## Problem Statement
Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using pure Python (no NumPy), and train it on the two moons dataset.

## Files
- `mlp.py` - Contains the MLP class
- `train.py` - Trains the MLP on the dataset
- `dataset.py` - Dataset generation using sklearn
- `plot.py` - Plots loss curve and decision boundary
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for plotting and data generation

## How to Run
```bash
python train.py
```

## Dependencies
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
